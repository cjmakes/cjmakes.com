<h1 id="what">What</h1>

<p>Blogging. There are many popular software engineering blogs that give programmers an outlet to discuss and share what they are working on. This is mine</p>

<h1 id="why">Why</h1>

<p>It will help me document the projects that I&rsquo;m working on in a slightly better way than git commit messages like &ldquo;Fix this thing&rdquo;.</p>

<h1 id="how">How</h1>

<p>The why this site is published involves a few moving parts, organized into 2 github repositories.</p>

<h1 id="cjmakes-blog">cjmakes-blog</h1>

<p>The source lives here in the form of a <a href="https://gethugo.io">hugo</a> site. This is a static site generator that will take the theme you install as a git submodule (I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/">hugo-xmin</a>). It takes your content as markdown files and formats it with your themes css &amp; js and then puts the generated site into a <code>/public</code> directory.</p>

<h1 id="cjmakes-com">cjmakes.com</h1>

<p>This is a repo that just hosts generated static content. It is a submodule in <code>cjmakes-blog</code> in the <code>public</code> directory. So once the static content is generated it can be commit here and pushed to the github repo. Here it is hosted as a github pages site.</p>

<h1 id="github-pages">Github pages</h1>

<p>I also have a custom domain setting in github pages that takes my dns from cloudflare</p>
